From horseback riding to soccer, your school aged child probably already has a full schedule. If you are asking yourself, “should my child add piano classes to their list of things to do," consider the benefits that come with signing your young one up for lessons. Maybe he or she won’t be the next Beethoven, but they’ll certainly have an easier time learning math, practicing good manners such as patience and dedication, and becoming a team player.</p><p><b>1. Playing piano improves academic skills.</b></p><p>While it is true that artfulness takes part in the creative-right side of the brain, piano very highly utilizes the calculative-left side of the brain as well. Playing music, and doing classroom math, are much more similar than most people think. By learning to use beat, rhythm, and scales, children learn how to also divide, create fractions, and recognize patterns. Lynn Kleiner, founder of Music Rhapsody in Redondo Beach, CA says that “music wires a child’s brain to help him better understand other areas of math.” As your child grows alongside their lessons, they will begin to recite songs, calling to use their short and long-term memory. Mary Larew, a Suzuki method teacher at the Neighborhood Music School in New Haven, Connecticut says that “Using a mnemonic device to do this is a method that can later be applied to other memory skills.” As your child explores the inner workings of our grand pianos, they will also begin to learn principles of physics, as they watch the hammers of the piano hit the strings, teaching them about harmonic and sympathetic vibrations.</p><picture>

<p><b>2. Playing piano develops physical skills.</b></p><p>All musical instruments in some fashion help children to develop better coordination and motor skills, requiring movements of some combination of the hands, arms, and feet; Playing piano requires the use of all three. Professor Kristen Regester, the Early Childhood Program Manager at Sherwood Community Music School at Columbia College Chicago says that this type of instrument can be an excellent physical release for “high-energy kids.” Keyboard instruments demand a high level of concentrated simultaneous movement from both the right and left hands. “It’s like patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time,” says Regester. Piano not only helps to develop ambidexterity, but promotes becoming comfortable sitting with healthy posture. This all promotes better performance in your child’s other extracurricular activities like dance and sports.</p><picture>

<p><b>3. Playing piano cultivates better social skills.</b></p><p>At our studio, we encourage students to take both private and class sessions as they progress through different skill levels. Class sessions require interaction and communication with peers, encouraging teamwork, as children must collaborate to create a crescendo or an accelerando. If a child is playing too loudly or quickly, they will have to adjust. Professor Kristen Register says that it’s important for “children to know and understand their individual part in a larger ensemble”..”these are the kinds of experiences we have in society”..”we need more group interaction and problem solving.”</p><p><b>4. Playing piano refines discipline and patience.</b></p><p>Learning to play the piano is all about delayed gratification. This is true even more so for our stringed instrument friends, because before you make a single sound you must go through the painstaking task of how to hold the violin or cello, hold your bow, and where to place your hands and feet. Playing any instrument teaches children to persevere for hours, months, and years of practice before they can reach a specific goal. In an individual lesson, focused attention is required for at least 30 minutes at a time. In group settings, students learn patience, and they must wait their turn to play their part individually. In waiting their turn to play, children learn to encourage and respect their their peers, as they sit still quietly for designated periods of time being attentive.</p><picture>

<p><b>5. Playing piano encourages high self-esteem.</b></p><p>Lessons create an environment where children can learn to accept as well as offer constructive criticism. “Turning negative feedback into positive change helps build self-confidence,” says Regester. Class lessons specifically teach children that they or anybody else is perfect and that we all have room for improvement and growth. “Presenting yourself in public is an important skill whether you become a professional musician or not. This skill is easily transferrable to public speaking, and of course, once a child is advanced enough, she’ll possess musical skills that will help her stand out.”</p><picture>

<p><b>6. Playing piano introduces your child to other cultures.</b></p><p>The piano has a rich history ranging from the middle ages to its modern form in 17th century Italy. Students at our studio are required to participate in learning the history of the piano and its many influential players and composers, as well as its impact on modern culture. Playing the piano, your child will be exposed to a wide repertoire of styles ranging from Classical to American Southern Jazz. It is important for children to familiarize themselves with different cultures and styles at a young age to foster open-mindedness about worlds and traditions beyond the ones they know.</p><p>What should you consider before deciding if piano lessons are right for your child? Here some questions to consider:</p><p>1. Is your child excited about piano? Many children can find the tedious practicing daunting, but if your child loves music and has the encouragement of their parents to also love the sound of the instrument, then lessons will never be dull or seem like a chore.</p><p>2. Does your child’s temperament match the piano? Piano is a great option for most children because unlike more delicate stringed instruments or heavy wind instruments, the piano offers a comfortable and rewarding learning curve fitting for both high and low-energy children.</p><p>3. Can you afford the costs associated with playing the piano? Before considering lessons for your child, know that practice at home is absolutely crucial. You don’t have to own a Steinway Grand, and there are many affordable practice keyboards for sale online and through music retailers here in Ocala like <a href="http://www.parramoremusic.com/">Paramore Music</a><a href="www.parramoremusic.com"></a>and <a href="http://soundexchange2.com/">Sound Exchange</a>.</p></div></article></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="50"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="51"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="52"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="53"><span data-reactid="54"><!-- react-empty: 55 --><h2 data-reactid="56"><a data-reactid="57">Capitano Music Studio </a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="59"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="60"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="61"></div></section></div></div>
