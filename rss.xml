            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Benefits of Music Education</h1><p>Whether your child is the next Beyonce or more likely to sing her solos in the shower, she is bound to benefit from some form of music education.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Piano?</h1><p>Ocala offers our children many mind nurturing activities. From horseback riding to soccer, your school aged child probably already has a full schedule. If you are asking yourself, “should my child add piano classes to their list of things to do," consider the benefits that come with signing your young one up for lessons. Maybe he or she won’t be the next Beethoven, but they’ll certainly have an easier time learning math, practicing good manners such as patience and dedication, and becoming a team player.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0ed7edc9d6886837774acb25b0bde7f65bc5d4bb.jpg"></article>]]></description>
